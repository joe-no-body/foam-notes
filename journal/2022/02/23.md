#i3wm

- a major advantage of tiling window managers is that it's harder to lose windows
  - before I started using i3 on Linux, I used window snapping on Windows and
    apps like Rectangle on macOS to keep my windows rigidly organized on the
    screen
  - after using i3, I've noticed that I'm much more inclined to arrange windows
    in ways that I previously would have considered messy -- overlapping and
    offset, with odd edges sticking out over one another
  - this puzzled me for a long time, but I just realized why I do it: I'm trying
    to keep as many windows visible as possible so they're easier to find
  - when using i3, I frequently use tabbed and stacked containers to group
    windows. a major advantage of tabbing and stacking is that each window's
    title bar remains visible at the top of the container, making it clear at a
    glance what's on screen
  - when snapping windows to perfect halves or quarters of the screen, any more
    than two in the same position means only the foremost window is visible
