## A request: please start your public project's README and docs with a quick summary and at least one example

When I'm looking at a project, the first thing I want to know is what it actually does and in what context. After that, I want to see what it looks like in practice.

Flask's README is a great example: https://github.com/pallets/flask

* If it's a library, framework, programming language, or anything else that the user expresses via code, just a simple "hello world"-level sample would be great.
