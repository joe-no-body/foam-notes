## setting up WebDAV for Joplin

#asahi #synology #homelab #joplin

- current WebDAV URL: `davs://webdav.asahi.zane.cloud/share1/...`
  - SSL doesn't validate
- set up a new URL: `davs://webdav-asahi.zane.cloud/share1/...`
  - ~synology makes this kinda annoyingly tedious
  - in **DNS Server**, I created a new entry `webdav-asahi.zane.cloud` under `zane.cloud`
  - in **Control Panel->Application Portal->Reverse Proxy**, I created a new entry routing `https://webdav-asahi.zane.cloud` to `https://asahi.zane.cloud:5006`
  - in **Control Panel->Security->Certificate->Configure**, I set `WebDAV Server` and `webdav-asahi.zane.cloud` to use the `zane.cloud` certificate
  - now the file browser doesn't complain about the cert when I try connecting
- joplin WebDAV URL: `davs://webdav-asahi.zane.cloud/share1/joplin-notes`
