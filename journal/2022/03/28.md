## Sudoku app wishlist

- note types
  - digit notes
    - locked in - like Cracking the Cryptic's centered digits, for when there's a pair (or triple) of digits that must go in a certain cell
    - significant - e.g. when twos can only go in a certain row or column of a particular house, thus indicating that they can't go in any other house in that particular row or column
    - excluded - digits that definitely can't go in a particular cell
    - possible - digits that are possible according to the basic rules of sudoku
  - cell notes
    - paired squares
- auto notes
