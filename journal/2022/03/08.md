## social media ideas

- a social forum site like reddit but communities are separate from topics
  - reddit conflates community and topic, so when multiple groups of people are
    interested in the same topic, you get competing subreddits
    - cases in point: /r/guns, /r/firearms, /r/liberalgunowners, and /r/socialistra
  - but what if you could join one or more social communities and see discussion
    on common topics?
