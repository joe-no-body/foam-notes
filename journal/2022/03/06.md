## sed

Notes in ~/Code/scratch/sed/sed.org

## why do I prefer foam to org mode for notes?

- maybe because I find VS Code more ergonomic for working with lots of files
- wonder if there's a good way to improve Emacs for that

## Bash/shell task manager

Because I feel like it. /shrugs

### todo.txt

looking at todo.txt because it's prior art

[[todo.txt]]

### a few thoughts on doing chores

- I don't actually want to _not_ do chores -- the fact that I get frustrated
  about them means I want them done. I just never want to do them right now

- barriers to doing chores
  - "I'll do it later" -- if "later" isn't a fixed time, it's easy to keep
    putting them off
  - lack of supporting goals -- if I don't have a deeper reason to do the chore,
    it's hard to find a reason to want to do it. e.g. my dining room is full of
    bags of recycling right now, but I don't really use it so it's hard to feel
    like doing it

- things that work
  - schedule time, preferably around an existing schedule
  - plan to do one thing
  - seize the impulse -- do it as soon as I feel like it -- I just got the urge
    to clip my fingernails, so before it faded I got up and went to the bathroom
    and just did it. if I'm in the kitchen and feel the slightest inclination to
    wash some dirty dishes or gather some trash, I do it. and if I only feel
    like doing one, then so be it
  - set myself up for success (e.g. if I need to take out the trash and it's
    cold, put on sweatpants now so I don't have to do it later)
- things that don't
  - making lists
