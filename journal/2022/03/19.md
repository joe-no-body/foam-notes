## org mode

#org-mode

Feels weird to note this in Foam rather than org but whatever.

### org mode structure templates


I learned from a [Stack Exchange post](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/12847) 
that you can type `<s` followed by TAB to insert a source block using
org's [structure templates](https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html).

Following the post's suggestion, I customized this in my .emacs file as follows:

```lisp
; insert lowercase #+begin_src blocks instead of the default allcaps ones
; the '?' denotes where the cursor should end up after the template is inserted
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("s" "#+begin_src ?\n#+end_src"))
; insert a shell script block
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("sh" "#+begin_src sh\n?\n#+end_src" ""))
```

## apt upgrade issue

Got a bunch of error spam during `apt upgrade`:

```
dpkg: error processing package libglib2.0-0:i386 (--configure):
 dependency problems - leaving triggers unprocessed
No apport report written because MaxReports is reached already
                                                              dpkg: dependency problems prevent
 processing triggers for libglib2.0-0:i386:
 libglib2.0-0:i386 depends on libc6 (>= 2.28); however:
  Package libc6:i386 is not configured yet.

[...repeat many times...]

dpkg: too many errors, stopping

Processing was halted because there were too many errors.

```

According to https://askubuntu.com/a/1285774, the fix is to run

```
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

followed by

```
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

That seems to have fixed it.
