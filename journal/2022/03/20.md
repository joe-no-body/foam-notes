## VS Code keyboard cheat sheet

I want a way to easily view my VS Code keyboard shortcuts, but I'm not easily finding a project to just generate those, so I guess I have to do it myself.

Here's a quick and dirty shell script to list out my custom bindings in a friendlier way:

```bash
sed -e 's|//.*||g' ~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json \
 | jq -r '.[] | select(.command[0:1] != "-") | [.key, .command, .when] | @tsv' \
 | sort \
 | column -s $'\t' -t
```

- using `sed` here to remove comments, which `jq `doesn't like
- I tried using `sed` to strip trailing commas too but it was easier to just remove those
- `jq `is used to filter unassignments (commands starting with `-`) and format the JSON as TSV data
- `sort` puts it all in order
- `column` formats it as a nice table

Of course, ideally it would be nice to have this all organized by function, so we can tell `sort` to sort on the command column:

```bash
sed -e 's|//.*||g' ~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json \
  | jq -r '.[] | select(.command[0:1] != "-") | [.key, .command, .when] | @tsv' \
  | sort -t $'\t' -k 2 \
  | column -s $'\t' -t
```

## org mode: why doesn't it work for daily notes?

#org-mode

I've had good success using org to organize writing and to take notes on programming topics using babel for interactivity, but I've never been able to make it click for daily notes and I don't really get why. It has a lot of functionality that makes me want to like it, but I've always bounced off it when I've tried.

Like, what makes it different from Foam? Foam is a much more limited tool but I've had a much easier time getting myself to use it.

Part of it is probably that Foam lives in VS Code, which I generally like better than Emacs for daily use, but that just raises the question of what's better about VS Code.
