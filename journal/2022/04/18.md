## Synology issue

#synology #homelab

- for some reason asahi.zane.cloud is returning a generic Synology 404 page ("Sorry, the page you are looking for is not found.")
- this caused my get_smart_stats.sh script to not respond
- was able to access DSM via https://asahi.zane.network:5001
- the Reverse Proxy tab under Application Portal seemed to just be spinning
- got impatient and restarted my NAS
- now I'm reminded that I use my NAS for DNS so while it's restarting things don't want to respond
- for some reason I'm unable to access my router at 192.168.1.1 either...
  - `curl -v 192.168.1.1` just stops after `> Accept: */*`
- `host google.com 8.8.8.8` does work so I do have IPv4 and UDP at least
- `curl -v 192.168.1.17` fail with `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.1.17 port 80: No route to host` (same issue if I use port 5001)
- after restarting my router, the network came back and asahi.zane.cloud works again
