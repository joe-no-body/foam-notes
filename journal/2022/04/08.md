## improving representations of code

#ideas

trying to capture some not-yet-coherent ideas on code representation and organization

- editors should display PR comments and annotations alongside code
  - maybe store those in `git notes` or something
- I want to be able to organize and navigate code in more sophisticated ways than just a rigid hierarchy of directories and files
  - editors and IDEs often let you make bookmarks, but they're not really designed for sharing as far as I can tell
  - navigation options like "Go to definition"/"Find usages" come close to what I want, but I want a way to persist those associations and better ways of annotating them
  - use case: in Django, you group all of your code by type, so if you have an entity like `Products`, your product views are in one file, your models are in another file, your forms are in yet another file, etc. which often means having a bunch of files open and jumping between them. I would like a way to create a virtual file in my editor that contains all of the product code in one place so I can navigate and edit it right there
- docs as code organization - instead of the literate programming approach (prose->code) or the generated docs approach (code->prose), I want code<->prose. let me write prose that is directly connected to elements of code and vice versa -- I guess like a wiki where you have actual code in the wiki's datastore.
