## Labyrinth

Ages ago, I found this program called Labyrinth that's very aptly described in [this Writing StackExchange question][lab1].

> I found this freeware app, labytrinth, years ago. It allowed to create elements (characters, places, objects, etc) and detail information about them. Then you could drag these elements into a wide area where you could set relationships in between them (arrows with little text tags). It also had a function where you could create a table with place / chapters / characters / etc in order to organise your plot and determine who was doing what and where. It was very basic: no colours, no great variety of arrows, but it worked perfectly.

Here's the killer feature:

> [...] So, if you decide to change the name of a character, labyrinth would automatically update the name in every diagram which included that element, whereas I have to change each diagram manually in YEd.



Someone replied saying they'd [decompiled and updated it][lab2], but as I recall the tool itself now seems pretty limited compared to what I want.
