# CouchDB

- [ ] versioning design docs, views, etc.?

- CouchDB itself seems active but the community doesn't seem to be very large :/
- I like the idea of being able to replicate data to local databases like PouchDB
- I'm intrigued about the idea of using design docs/views/etc. to store logic in the database itself
  - seems useful for RAD type work

- "Django may be built for the Web, but CouchDB is built of the Web."
